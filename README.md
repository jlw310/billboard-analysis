# dataset

This project uses the data compiled by Chris Dallas Rivera of all 
Billboard number one hits from 1958 to January 2025, which I found on the Data is Plural Archive.

# description

I thought that this dataset could be a good way to measure how the technology we use to find & listen to music impacts the kind of music that is most successful. 
The data was split into 3 eras: Pre-digital (1958-2006, physical sales, radio),
streaming (2007-2010, platforms like Spotify dominate), and post Short-Form content (2020-present, where songs go viral on TikTok, etc.).

Some questions investigated:
1. How has song length changed across consumption eras?
2. What artist structure (solo vs. group) dominated each era?
3. How have artist, songwriter, and producer racial and gender demographics evolved?
4. Are artists more likely to be songwriters and producers in the streaming and short-form content eras?

# some interesting findings:

As expected, song length has gone down, on average, over the 3 eras consecutively. A lot of songs nowadays don't have 
bridges/variation by section, because they can be successful with a viral soundbite on short-form content platforms.

Hip Hop dropped from above 20% of hits to below 5% of hits from the streaming to post short-form eras.

Groups/bands were below 10% of top hits in the streaming era, but rose back up to ~40% post short-form. 

Artists being producers on their hit has actually decreased consecutively.

The artists, songwriting, and producing are more male dominated now than in previous eras.
